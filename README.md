K3NG Arduino CW Keyer with keying over MIDI changes

This is a version of the K3NG Arduino CW Keyer (http://blog.radioartisan.com/arduino-cw-keyer/) with additions to key via USB MIDI (needs an app on the computer to use these signals). Tested with a Teensy 3.2 board. Used for remote keying a Flex 6000 series radio on macOS with the xKEY application.
